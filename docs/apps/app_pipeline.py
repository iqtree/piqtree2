# We can combine `piqtree` apps with other cogent3 apps to develop a pipeline. There are multiple concepts involved here, particularly data stores, composed apps, parallel execution, log files etc... See the cogent3 [app documentation](https://cogent3.org/doc/app/index.html) for more details.
#
# To develop a pipeline efficiently we only need a subset of the sequences in an alignment. We will use the [diverse-seq](https://pypi.org/project/diverse-seq/) plugin for that purpose. This allows selecting a specified subset of sequences that capture the diversity in an alignment.
#
# But first, we need the data.

# We open this directory as a cogent3 data store.

dstore = open_data_store(alns_path, suffix="fa")
dstore.describe

# %% [markdown]
# We need to create some apps to: load data, a divergent sequence selector app, drop alignment columns containing non-canonical nucleotides (so gaps and N's), select alignments with a minimym number of aligned columns, a "data store" to write results to and a writer. These will then be combined into a single composed app which will be applied to all the alignments in the data store.
